# Pascal-Interpretor
FUN EDUCATIONAL PROJECT
This is a toy pascal interpretor which I am developing as a side project for fun when I have some spare time.
Currently it only has a Lexer and an Interpretor in one place.
It can perform simple computation like making tokens from user input and process the 
tokens and return the result. Only basic arithmetic computation can be processed by
the parser.
