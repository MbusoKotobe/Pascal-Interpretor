# Pascal-Interpretor (FUN EDUCATIONAL PROJECT)
This is a toy pascal interpretor which I am developing as a side project for fun when I have some spare time.

# FEATURES
The interpreter currently performs simple arithmatic computation:
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Division
* Modulo

The interpreter can also process arbitrary expressions containing all the supported arithmetic 
e.g *5 + 2 - 1 x 11 รท 2*

#MORE WORK WILL BE ADDED WHEN I HAVE TIME.
